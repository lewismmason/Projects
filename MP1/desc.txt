Mini Project 1:


Client-Server-Client multiplayer interactions for videogames and other
turn-based applications. This will be done for an extremely basic prototype
"card game" with minimal gameplay.


Goal:
Learn how to do server-client stuff in related to gameplay between
users, not database related. 


Stage 1:
Server and 2 clients (all gdscript) on same device, able to "play" basic card
game

Stage 2:
Server and 2 clients all on separate devices (mobile, comp, old comp)

Stage 3:
Try to set it up with external server not hosted LAN. This is the part that 
teaches me the most new skills and techniques.
